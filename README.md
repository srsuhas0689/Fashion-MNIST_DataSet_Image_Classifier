The Fashion-MNIST dataset is a collection of images used for computer vision tasks, similar to the popular MNIST dataset for handwritten digits recognition. Instead of digits, the Fashion-MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of 28x28 pixels each, representing various clothing items from 10 different categories. The dataset is widely used as a benchmark for testing and comparing different machine learning and deep learning models for image classification tasks.

Here are the 10 categories of clothing items in the Fashion-MNIST dataset:

T-shirt/top
Trouser
Pullover
Dress
Coat
Sandal
Shirt
Sneaker
Bag
